# macro-mod-scripts




Welcome. Here i'll publish some scripts for the Macro Keybind Mod (by Mumfrey).
All Scripts will work for Minecraft 1.12.2.

Here's what you are about to see here in the future:

  - Auto-Furnace
  - Take/Store-Items (Chests, Hoppers, etc.)
  - Cobble-Gen-Scripts
  - Auto-Farming
  - Baritone-powered Automation
  - Auto-Crafting
  - Auto-Reply-System
  - and so much more....
 
Some of these scripts use 3rd party Modules and can only run, if you have them installed. You can get those modules at: https://spthiel.github.io/Modules/
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me on Discord (CobbleShop#4571)
